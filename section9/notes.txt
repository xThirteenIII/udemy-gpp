-static_cast<type>() is more secure than (type)var_name casting, called C-type casting, because 
apart from being more clear it throws out errors when compiling if casting is not supported.

-cin.good() verifies if the input is of the correct type

-initialize ints var to 0, otherwise they get random values

-cout << setprecision(n) << num sets the floating num to n number of decimals
